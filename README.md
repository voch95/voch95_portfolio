# Hi, I'm Vlad Chelcea

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. I'm a master's student in Systems, Control & Robotics at KTH (Sweden), with a BSc in Electrical Engineering. My work blends electrical engineering and a variety of different types of systems.

- MSc in Systems, Control & Robotics @ KTH
- Interests: AI, NLP, Deep Learning, Control Systems
- Currently working on: Automatic Term Recognition in Gaming Patch Notes + Domain Generalizability

## Skills
- **Languages**:
-   Primarily Python and MATLAB.
-   Other languages previously revised include C, C#, C++, Java, Go, Assembly
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, ROS, HuggingFace
- **Concepts**: Electrical Engineering, Signal & Control Theory, Embedded Systems, Estimation, ML, DL, NLP, Robotics
- **Tools**: Git, Linux, Agile workflows, Obsidian

## Previous Projects

Many of my projects were conducted as part of my studies at KTH. To respect academic integrity and university policy:
- Source code and detailed reports are not made publicly available.
- Project summaries and overviews are shared where possible.
- Full materials can be shared upon request under special circumstances (e.g. for academic or recruitment purposes).

Feel free to contact me directly if you'd like to learn more.
